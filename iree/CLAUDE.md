## Beads Workflow Integration

<!-- br-agent-instructions-v1 -->

This project uses [beads_rust](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust) (`br`/`bd`) for issue tracking. Issues are stored in `.beads/` and local only.
CRITICAL: NEVER MENTION BEADS IN CODE. The beads are for your local work tracking only and do not persist. Always write proper TODOs or use github issues for long term/persistent tracking. 95% of all work you do should be tracked in beads. Think of it like a memory.

### Essential Commands

```bash
# View ready issues (unblocked, not deferred)
br ready              # or: bd ready

# List and search
br list --status=open # All open issues
br show <id>          # Full issue details with dependencies
br search "keyword"   # Full-text search

# Create and update
br create --title="..." --description="..." --type=task --priority=2
br update <id> --status=in_progress
br close <id> --reason="Completed"
br close <id1> <id2>  # Close multiple issues at once
```

### Workflow Pattern

1. **Start**: Run `br ready` to find actionable work
2. **Claim**: Use `br update <id> --status=in_progress`
3. **Work**: Implement the task
4. **Complete**: Use `br close <id>`
5. **Sync**: Always run `br sync --flush-only` at session end

### Key Concepts

- **Dependencies**: Issues can block other issues. `br ready` shows only unblocked work.
- **Priority**: P0=critical, P1=high, P2=medium, P3=low, P4=backlog (use numbers 0-4, not words)
- **Types**: task, bug, feature, epic, chore, docs, question
- **Blocking**: `br dep add <issue> <depends-on>` to add dependencies

### Best Practices

- Check `br ready` at session start to find available work
- Update status as you work (in_progress → closed)
- Create new issues with `br create` when you discover tasks
- Use descriptive titles and set appropriate priority/type
- Always sync before ending session
