## [0.0.8] - 2026-02-06

### Changed
- Improved skill auto-detection: added trigger phrases ("mark it/them", "mark me", "mark this/these", "save as/to marks", etc.) so AI agents invoke the skill automatically without explicit references

## [0.0.7] - 2026-02-05

### Changed
- Improved marks.md template: concise two-line header referencing the mark-and-recall skill
- Improved mark-and-recall skill: reframed as cross-session context bridge, added creation/staleness guidance, selection criteria

- File decoration: files with marks are highlighted in the explorer, tabs, and open editors with a blue color tint and mark count badge
- `markAndRecall.fileDecoration.enabled` setting to toggle file decorations

## [0.0.5] - 2026-02-05
